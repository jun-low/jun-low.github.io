		Thanks for stopping by. For the past 3 years, my professional journey spans various industries,
		from non-profit organizations and SaaS startups, which has sharpened my ability to collaborate
		effectively with cross-functional teams and problem-solving skills. I enjoy bridging the gap
		between my
		<span class="text-primary">technical knowledge</span> with my <span class="text-primary"
			>keen eye for design</span
		>
		to create a user friendly product. My goal is to always build scalable applications while providing
		engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.
		<br /><br />
		So far my journey has been one of continuous learning, which is why I love collaborating with people
		and exchanging skills. When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I enjoy hiking, walk my dogs,
		and playing piano. I'm always <span class="text-primary"
			>looking for a new room to flourish and grow</span
		>.

		Code to me feels like I'm <span class="text-primary">learning a new instrument</span>, an
		instrument that is only limited by my imagination. Finding solutions became just as creative as
		writing a new song. Reading code for me is like reading sheet music â€” the printed notes require
		interpretation and execution. <br /><br />Every day I code it takes me a little closer to <span
			class="text-primary">building anything I can dream of</span
		>; and that sense of satisfaction I get after finishing a project is something I haven't felt in
		years.
