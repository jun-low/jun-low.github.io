		Thanks for stopping by. For the past 3 years, I've excelled in engineering teams at SaaS
		companies and digital marketing agency. I'm currently working remotely at

		building things for the software with some awesome people. I enjoy bridging the gap between my
		<span class="text-primary">technical knowledge</span> with my <span class="text-primary"
			>keen eye for design</span
		>
		to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build scalable applications while providing engaging,
		pixel-perfect user experiences.

		So far my journey has been one of continuous learning, which is why I love collaborating with people
		and exchanging skills. When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I enjoy hiking, walk my dogs,
		and playing piano. I'm always <span class="text-primary"

		interpretation and execution. Every day I code it takes me a little closer to <span
			class="text-primary">building anything I can dream of</span
		>; and that sense of satisfaction I get after finishing a project is something I haven't felt in
		years.
